                  <h4><b>Additional Information from the SEC regarding 506C and 506B offerings
                    Advertising Approved for Unregistered Securities Offerings</b></h4>

                    The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy is issuing this Investor Alert
                      to educate individual investors about advertisements and announcements for
                      investment opportunities in certain securities offerings. General advertising is
                      
                      permitted in certain offerings as a result of rules adopted by the SEC as required
                      by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.<br><br>

                      You may begin to see advertising and announcements for opportunities to invest
                      in certain securities offerings, some-times called private placements. These
                      offerings may be for shares in a company or interests in a private fund, such as a
                      hedge fund or venture capital fund. The advertising may be through a number of
                      different means, including the Internet, social media, seminars, print, or radio or
                      television broadcast. The rules permitting this general advertising take effect on
                      September 23, 2013.<br><br>

                      <h4><b>What is a private placement?</b></h4>     

                      A securities offering exempt from registration with the SEC is sometimes referred
                      to as a private placement. Under the federal securities laws, a company or
                      private fund may not offer or sell securities unless the offering has been<br>
                      registered with the SEC or an exemption is available. Private and public
                      companies engage in private placements to raise funds from investors. Private
                      funds, such as hedge funds, also raise investment capital through private
                      placements.<br>
                      Private placements are not subject to some of the laws and regulations that are
                      designed to protect investors, such as disclosure requirements that apply to
                      registered offerings.<br>
                      as noted above, the SEC recently adopted rules to permit general solicitation or
                      advertising for certain securities offerings that are exempt from registration. as
                      described below, these offerings, referred to here as Rule 506(c) offerings, must
                      comply with a number of requirements.<br><br>

                      <h4><b>Am I qualified to invest in a Rule 506(c) offering?</b></h4>

                      Only accredited investors may invest in a Rule 506(c) offering. This limitation
                      exists because these offerings do not have the same investor protections as, and
                      have unique risks when compared to, offerings that are registered with the SEC.<br>
                      an accredited investor, in the context of an individual investor, is a person who:<br>
                      
                     > had income in excess of $200,000 (or $300,000 with a spouse) in each
                      of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the same for the current
                      year, OR <br>
                    
                      > has a net worth over $1 million, either alone or with a spouse (excluding
                      the value of the person’s primary residence or any loans secured by the
                      residence (up to the value of the residence)).<br><br>

                      <h4><b>How will the company or private fund know whether I am an accredited
                        investor?</b></h4>

                        In a rule 506(c) offering, the company or private fund is required to take
                        reasonable steps to verify your accredited investor status, which could include
                        reviewing documentation, such as W-2s, tax returns, bank and brokerage
                        statements, credit reports and the like. Depending on the circumstances, the
                        company or private fund may rely on a written confirmation from a third party to
                        verify your accredited investor status. The SEC does not require any specific
                        verification method or process for companies or private funds for these offerings.<br><br>

                        Third-party verification. If the company or private fund accepts a written
                        confirmation from a third party to verify whether you are an accredited investor,
                        the third party may be a registered broker-dealer, SEC-registered investment
                        adviser, licensed attorney or certified public accountant. The third party could be
                        engaged by the company or private fund, or could be retained by you (e.g., your
                        personal broker-dealer, investment adviser, attorney or certified public
                        accountant). You can obtain information about a registered broker by visiting
                        FInra’s BrokerCheck website. You can obtain information about an investment
                        adviser by visiting the SEC’s Investment adviser Public Disclosure (IaPD) website.
                        You can obtain information about a licensed attorney or certified public
                        accountant by contacting the appropriate state bar or board of accountancy.<br><br>

                        You do not have to provide any information if you do not feel comfortable doing
                        so. If you do not provide all of the requested information, you should not be able
                        to invest in the particular offering if the company or private fund is unable to
                        verify that you are an accredited investor.<br><br>

                        If the company or private fund offering the securities does not take steps to verify
                        your accredited investor status or allows you to participate in the offering even
                        though you do not meet the income or net worth criteria discussed above, this
                        may be a warning sign that the company or private fund is not complying with
                        the federal securities laws and is something to consider before investing  in the
                        offering.<br><br>

                        <h4><b>Investor Bulletin: Accredited Investors</b></h4>

                        The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy is issuing this Investor
                        Bulletin to educate individual investors about what it means to be an “accredited
                        investor.”<br><br>

                        <h4><b>What does it mean to be an accredited investor?</b></h4>

                        Under the federal securities laws, a company or private fund may not offer or sell
                        securities unless the transaction has been registered with the SEC or an
                        exemption from registration is available. Certain securities offerings that are
                        exempt from registration may only be offered to, or purchased by, persons who
                        are accredited investors. One principal purpose of the accredited investor
                        concept is to identify persons who can bear the economic risk of investing in
                        these unregistered securities. Unlike offerings registered with the SEC in which
                        certain information is required to be disclosed, companies and private funds,
                        such as a hedge fund or venture capital fund, engaging in these exempt
                        offerings do not have to make prescribed disclosures to accredited investors.
                        These offerings, sometimes referred to as private placements, involve unique
                        risks and you should be aware that you could lose your entire investment. The
                        SEC recently adopted rules to permit general advertising for certain exempt
                        offerings.<br><br>

                        <h4><b>Are you an accredited investor?</b></h4>

                        An accredited investor, in the context of a natural person, includes anyone who:

                        > earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a
                        spouse) in each of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the
                        same for the current year, OR
                        > has a net worth over $1 million, either alone or together with a
                        spouse(excluding the value of the person’s primary residence).


                        On the income test, the person must satisfy the thresholds for the three years
                        consistently either alone or with a spouse, and cannot, for example,satisfy one
                        year based on individual income and the next two years based on joint income
                        with a spouse. The only exception is if a person is married within this period, in
                        which case the person may satisfy the threshold on the basis of joint income for
                        the years during which the person was married and on the basis of individual
                        income for the other years. In addition, entities such as banks, partnerships,
                        corporations, nonprofits and trusts may be accredited investors. Of the entities
                        that would be considered accredited investors and depending on your
                        circumstances, the following may be relevant to you:<br><br>

                        > Any trust, with total assets in excess of $5 million, not formed to
                        specifically purchase the subject securities, whose purchase is directed
                        by a sophisticated person, or <br>
                        > Any entity in which all of the equity owners are accredited investors.<br><br>

                        In this context, a sophisticated person means the person must have, or the
                        company or private fund offering the securities reasonably believes that this
                        person has, sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business
                        matters to evaluate the merits and risks of the prospective investment.<br><br>

                        <h4><b>How do I calculate my net worth?</b></h4>

                        To qualify as an accredited investor under the net worth test, you must have a
                        net worth that exceeds $1 million, either alone or with a spouse. If calculating joint
                        net worth with a spouse, it is not necessary that property be held jointly.
                        Calculating net worth involves adding up all your assets and subtracting all your
                        liabilities. The resulting sum is your net worth.<br><br>

                        The value of your primary residence is not included in your net worth calculation.
                        In addition, any mortgage or other loan on the residence does not count as a
                        liability up to the fair market value of the residence. If the loan is for more than
                        the fair market value of the residence (i.e., if your mortgage is underwater), then
                        the loan amount that is over the fair market value counts as a liability under the
                        net worth test. Further, any increase in the loan amount in the 60 days prior to
                        your purchase of the securities (even if the loan amount does not exceed the
                        value of the residence) will count as a liability as well. The reason for this is to
                        prevent net worth from being artificially inflated through converting home equity<br><br>

          jobs.
          <br> <br> 
          In the last 5 years, over $40 billion has been invested in the US by foreign nationals applying for the EB-5 Investor Visa. The program is well established and has been renewed over 30 times with bipartisan support in Congress. On average over 90% of applicants are approved by the US government. Over 78,000 people have invested in EB-5 projects to receive their US Green Cards. </h4>

                          There are pros and cons – direct projects can offer greater involvement in the project and a higher ability to customize to an investors specific needs such as bringing in liquidity over time instead of all at once.There are usually higher IRRs or coupons, and the ability to own a potential income producing operating asset for a much longer duration. There is only one investor per project (by legal entity) per the newly updated regulations (RIA) which gives greater cushion for investors especially in labor intensive industries.

                          No, an investor’s I-526 petition that was accepted by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) does not qualify as an exemplar petition. A regional centre submits an exemplar petition as part of its I-924 petition to become a regional centre. However, if the I-526 petition of an investor has been granted by USCIS, it indicates that the project’s business documentation have been reviewed and found to be in order. As long as their source-of-funds evidence is accepted, the other EB-5 investors in the project can anticipate I-526 clearance.

                          United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) requires proof of the costs used to compute employment creation for programmes that count direct, indirect, and induced job creation. Invoices and other payment evidence may be included in this record. W-2s and payroll records must be provided for projects that only count direct employment. The requisite jobs must have been created or are in the process of being created, according to Form I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status. In order to complete Form I-829, investors must closely coordinate with their EB-5 project, immigration lawyer, and regional centre (if applicable). From the very beginning of the project, it is essential for the EB-5 project or regional centre to monitor economic indicators including operational revenue and the total number of employment produced. By doing this, the investor will have an easier time submitting their I-829 petition successfully and avoiding a denial. I-9 data and the project’s financial statements could also be wise to send.

The primary of the investment must remain at risk until unconditional permanent resident status is given; while a return on investment is allowed, a return of the investment is not.

                                    The main difference between the two is that, in a regional center program, you invest in a business through a business entity that has been USCIS approved for such purposes in the past while, in a traditional direct program, you invest directly into the enterprise. Regional Center projects can count indirect jobs, tend to be much larger and can cost more for the investor because of high administrative overload and compliance costs – RC projects usually take in many more investors than direct projects, which are currently allowed only 1 investor (with a FT job creation requirement of 10 jobs per investor).

                                    This is highly specific to the project – a quality direct investment in the right location and the right management team can provide a pathway to a green card and also be a great investment in its own right. In a RC setting there can be a competition for jobs with investors from non backlogged countries getting access to the job creation ahead of those from heavily backlogged countries, and complete dependence on the RC management for documentation and support. The truth is that some projects such as those that rely on labor and can easily create direct jobs such as in education, lend themselves better to a direct model while others that are more capital and construction intensive are a better fit for RC. Some direct projects that are in critical socially needed areas such as care may have a chance to get an expedited status, further speeding up adjudication.

          <h5>
            <b style="font-size: 16px; color: #00365b;">Each school, with capacity 200 children, creates a minimum of 26 fulltime jobs.</b>  <br><br>
            • The school will open with minimum 6 FTEs (center director,
              parent relationship manager, cleaners, initial teachers), regardless
              of the number of enrolments. <br><br>
            • Strict ratios (e.g. 1 teacher per 4 infants
              under 18m), ensure that 10 full time jobs will be created by the time the center
              has 30 children (15% of capacity); typically within the first six months of opening.<br><br>
            • In addition, the schools operate 60 hours/week. The definition of 1 FTE (for calculating jobs)
              is 35 hours/week. So one full time teacher is equivalent to 1.7 FTE, giving an additional cushion.<br><br>
            • A typical school, with a capacity of 200 children, can create 25+ full-time jobs when fully operational,
              with 5 jobs created before the opening.<br><br>
            • Strict caregiving and teacher-to-student ratios mandated by law, 
              as low as 4:1 for infants ensure job creation even at low capacities.
